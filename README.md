# top-project-ruby_substrings
## Find the count of occurences of substrings from a dictionary which are in a given string.

* You can run the script in irb or with:

```
ruby ./app.rb
```

* The terminal will ask you, the user, for input for the string to check, as well as the dictionary.
    * Note that case is not sensitive

* The program returns a hash with the results as an object, as well as prints them to the screen
in human readable format
